# if Expressions

`if` expressions provide a way for programs to make
decisions about if a section of code should be
run or not. They are created with:

1. The `if` keyword
2. A condition to check
3. A block of code to run if the condition is true.

For example, this will check if the number `3` is
less than or equal to `4`. Since it is, we'll get the output
`alfa`.

#### SOURCE CODE

```rust, noplayground, EXAMPLE1
fn main() {

  if 3 <= 4 {
    println!("alfa");
  }

}
```

#### CODE RUNNER

```rust, editable, CODE1

```
