# If/Else

We can provide an alternate block of code
to run for situations where the condition in the
`if` expression is not `true`. This is done
with an `else` like below where we check to see
if `5` is less than `<` the number `4`. Since it's not
the `else` statement is run and we get the output
`bravo`.

#### SOURCE CODE

```rust, noplayground, EXAMPLE1
fn main() {

  if 8 < 7 {
    println!("8 is less than 7");
  } else {
    println!("8 is greater than 7");
  }

}
```
