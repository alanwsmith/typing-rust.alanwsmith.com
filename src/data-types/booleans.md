# Booleans

Rust has another fundamental data type
called "Boolean".

A boolean is either true or false. It
can't be anything else. They use the
`bool` keyword and are assigned like
this:

```rust,noplayground
let bravo: bool = false;
```

Used in a full program it looks like this:

#### SOURCE CODE

```rust,noplayground, EXAMPLE1
fn main() {

  let alfa: bool = true;

  println!("Value {}", alfa);

}
```

#### CODE RUNNER

```rust,editable, CODE1

```
