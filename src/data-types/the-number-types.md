# The Number Types

We've seen both `f32` for floating point numbers
that have a decimal points and `i32` for integers
that don't. There's a third type of number
called `u32` which is for "unsigned integer".

A regular `i32` integer can be both positive
and negative where the negative numbers have
a "`-`" sign in front of them. When we say
a `u32` is unsigned, it means it can't have
a "`-`" sign. That it turn means it can't
be negative.

This brings us to the `32` that follows the
`f`, `i`, and `u` in the types. It
determines how big a number can be used for
the varaible.

Here's the values for floating point numbers

| type | lowest number | highest number |
| ---- | ------------- | -------------- |
| f8   | TKTKTKT       | TKTKTKT        |
| f16  | TKTKTKT       | TKTKTKT        |
| f32  | TKTKTKT       | TKTKTKT        |
| f64  | TKTKTKT       | TKTKTKT        |
| f128 | TKTKTKT       | TKTKTKT        |

Here's the values for integers

| type | lowest number | highest number |
| ---- | ------------- | -------------- |
| i8   | TKTKTKT       | TKTKTKT        |
| i16  | TKTKTKT       | TKTKTKT        |
| i32  | TKTKTKT       | TKTKTKT        |
| i64  | TKTKTKT       | TKTKTKT        |
| i128 | TKTKTKT       | TKTKTKT        |

And, here's the values for unsigned integers

| type | lowest number | highest number |
| ---- | ------------- | -------------- |
| u8   | TKTKTKT       | TKTKTKT        |
| u16  | TKTKTKT       | TKTKTKT        |
| u32  | TKTKTKT       | TKTKTKT        |
| u64  | TKTKTKT       | TKTKTKT        |
| u128 | TKTKTKT       | TKTKTKT        |

### TODO

- Fill in the high/low values

- Add notes about `arch`
