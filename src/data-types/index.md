# Data Types

Rust has "data types". Each one defines a different
kind of data. Every value in Rust has to fit
into one of those types. For example, numbers
without decimal points have a type of `i32`.

One way to think about it is like asking someone
what kind of dog they have.

```txt
What kind of dog is Charlie?

A golden retriever
```

We can ask a similar question about values in Rust:

```txt
What type of variable is alfa?

An i32
```
