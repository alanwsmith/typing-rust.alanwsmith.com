# The i32 Type

The first type we'll talk about is `i32`.
It's a number without decimal places.
We've been using it without calling its
type out by name.

When we need to think about types we
can now say that we're binding an
`i32` value of `7` to the varailbe
name `alfa`

#### SOURCE CODE

```rust, noplayground, EXAMPLE1
fn main() {
  let alfa = 7;
  println!("alfa is {alfa}");
}
```
