# The i32 Type

We've already see the `i32` type a lot.
It's a number. We've only seen positive
numbers, but it can be negative too. We've
also seen that you can do math on them.
Here's an example showing both those
features with variables:

#### SOURCE CODE

```rust, noplayground, EXAMPLE1
fn main() {

  let alfa = 7;
  let bravo = 9;

  let charlie = alfa - bravo;

  println!("charlie is {}", charlie);

}
```

### CODE RUNNER

```rust, editable, CODE1

```
