# Using Explicit Types

Setting data types implicitly like this:

```rust,noplayground
let alfa = 7;
```

or explicitly like this:

```rust,noplayground
let alfa: i32 = 7;
```

are both frequency occurrances in Rust
programs. While the implict version is
shorter to type and easier to read we'll
be using the explicit approach for a
few reasons:

1. To get used to the idea that every
   value has a type
2. To use a consistent format in our
   examples
3. Because you can always use explicit
   compared to implicit types which only
   work sometimes.
