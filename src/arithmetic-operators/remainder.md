# Remainder Operator

The remainder operator gives us the value
that's left over after putting one
number into another as many times as
possible. (TODO: Look up the math
term for this)

For example, `2` goes into `9` four times
with a remainder of `1`. So, this code
outputs:

```txt
alfa is 1
```

### SOURCE CODE

```rust, noplayground, EXAMPLE1
fn main() {
  let alfa = 9 % 2;
  println!("alfa is {alfa}");
}
```
