# Functions

Each program we make will have a `main()` funciton.
It's the first things that gets executed.

We can create other functions as well. We'll use
three types of functions with the following
properties:

1. Does not accept arguments - Has no return value
2. Accepts arguments - Has no return value
3. Does not accept arguments - Does have a return value
4. Accepts arguments - Does have a return value

The formulas for each of the three types are
on the next three pages. Don't worry too much
about memorizing them. We'll use each plenty
of times.
