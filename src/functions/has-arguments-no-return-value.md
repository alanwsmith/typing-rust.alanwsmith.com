# Functions That Take Arguments But Have No Return Value

The formula for functions that _do_ take
arguments without returning a value is must
the same as functions that don't. The
difference is that the `()` parens are
populated to let the function know about
the incoming data

1. The `fn` keyword
2. A name
3. Parenthesis with argument details. For example: `(thing: String)`
4. A set of `{}` curly brackets surrounding the function's code block
