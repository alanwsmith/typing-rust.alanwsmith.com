# Quick Notes

A few quick notes before we continue:

- These are my actual, in-progress notes on learning
  Rust. As such, the site is very much a work in progress.
  It only goes far as I've made it in my studies.

- The content is designed for folks who have at least some
  programming experience. If you know what variables,
  functions, loops, and conditionals are, you'll be fine.

- Examples are kept intentionally sort. That often
  means doing things that would be silly in a useful
  program. For example, defining a variable that's
  used only once on the following line. The goal is to
  show _how_ to use something not _when_ to use it.

- The site is designed for you to type in the examples.
  I learn best that way, but not everyone does. Reading
  it like a book without typing the examples is a perfectly
  fine way to do it too. (Though, I really do encourage
  you to stick with typing for a bit to see if it starts
  to work for you)
