# Quick Notes

A few quick notes before we continue:

- This site is a work in progress. It's built from
  my actual, in-progress notes. It only goes
  as far as I've made it learning the language.

- The content is designed for folks who have a little
  programming experience. If you know what variables,
  loops, conditionals, and functions are you'll be fine.

- Examples are intentionally sort. That often
  means doing things that would be silly in useful
  programs. For example, defining a variable that's
  used only once on the following line. The goal is to
  show _how_ to use something not _when_ to use it.

- The Code Runners have a "Disable Status Line" button.
  Hit that to prevent the status line from warning you
  about typos if you want to change code to play with the
  code samples.
