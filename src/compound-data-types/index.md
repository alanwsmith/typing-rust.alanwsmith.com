# Compound Data Types

The floating-point, integer, boolean, and character
types we've covered so far each hold a single value.
The name for that group of types is "scalar" types.
Rust has another category of types called "compound"
types. Instead of being limited to a single values,
compound types can handle multiple values.

Compound types come in two flavors: Tuples and Arrays.
