# Compound Data Types

The floating-point, integer, and boolean data
types we've covered each hold a single value.
Collectively, they're called "scalar" types (TODO:
find where the term scalar comes from)

Rust has another category of types called "compound"
types. They hold multiple values instead of being
constrained to a single one.

Compound data types come in two flavors: Tuples and Arrays.
