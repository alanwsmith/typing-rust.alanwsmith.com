# Variables

Variables in Rust are created with the `let` keyword followed
by the name to use, a `=` sign, and finally the value to bind to.

Here's a basic example (we'll talk about `{alfa}`
on the next page):

#### EXAMPLE

```rust,noplayground,EXAMPLE1
fn main() {
  let alfa = 7;
  println!("The value is {alfa}");
}
```

#### CODE RUNNER

```rust,editable,CODE1

```

#### TODO

- Verify Rust uses the term bind for assigning variables.
