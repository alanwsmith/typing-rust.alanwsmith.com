# Variables

Variables in Rust are created with:

1. The `let` keyword
2. The name to use (e.g. `alfa` in this case)
3. The `=` sign
4. The value to bind to it (e.g. `7` in this case)

Here's a basic example. We'll talk about the `{alfa}`
in `println!()` on the next page. For now, use the
Code Runner to run the code.

#### SOURCE CODE

```rust,noplayground,EXAMPLE1
fn main() {
  let alfa = 7;
  println!("Alfa {alfa}");
}
```

#### CODE RUNNER

```rust,editable,CODE1

```
