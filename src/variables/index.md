# Variables

Now, let's take a look at variables. Basic variables
in Rust are created using the following structure:

1. The `let` keyword
2. A name
3. The `=` sign
4. The value
5. A `;`

Using `alfa` for the name and `7` for the value we
get this:

```rust, noplayground
let alfa = 7;
```

Using that line in we can create another full program
that defines the `alfa` variable then prints it out.

#### SOURCE CODE

```rust,noplayground,EXAMPLE1
fn main() {

  let alfa = 7;

  println!("alfa is {}", alfa);

}
```

#### CODE RUNNER

```rust,editable,CODE1

```
