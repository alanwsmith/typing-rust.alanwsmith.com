# Variables

Basic Rust variables are created using this
formula:

1. The `let` keyword
2. A name
3. The `=` sign
4. The value
5. A `;`

The values for a string of text looks like this:
`String::from("apple")`. Using that and `alfa` for
the name this is how we create a variable:

```rust,noplayground
let alfa = String::from("apple");
```

In Rust, setting variables is called "binding".
So, the above line binds a `String` with the
text "apple" to the variable `alfa.
