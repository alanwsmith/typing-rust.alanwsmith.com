# Variables

Basic Rust variables are created using this
formula:

1. The `let` keyword
2. A name
3. The `=` sign
4. The value
5. A `;`

Text values can be created in Rust like this:

```rust,noplayground
String::from("apple")
```

Using that as a value and `alfa` for a name we
come to this line based on our formula above:

```rust,noplayground
let alfa = String::from("apple");
```

In Rust, setting variables is called "binding".
So, the above line binds the text "apple"
to the variable `alfa.
