# Variables In println!

This is the same code from the prior page. It
assigns the value `7` to the variable `alfa`
with the `let` keyword.

```rust,noplayground
fn main() {
  let alfa = 7;
  println!("The value is {alfa}");
}
```

The variable is used in `println!()` by using its
name inside `{` and `}` curly brackets.

There are other
ways to use the curly brackets that we'll see later
but this is the way we'll use it for now.
