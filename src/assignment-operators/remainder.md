# Remainder

We use the `%=` (remainder) assignment
gives us the remainder from a division
operation. For example, dividing `9`
by `2` results in `2` going into `9`
four times with a remainder of `1`. That
`1` is what the `%=` will give us.

#### SOURCE CODE

```rust, noplayground, EXAMPLE1
fn main() {

  let mut alfa = 9;
  alfa %= 2;

  println!("alfa is {}", alfa);
