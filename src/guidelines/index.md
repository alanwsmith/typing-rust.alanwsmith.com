# Guildlines

These are not hard rules. They are guidelines.
Staying from them when it makes sense makes
total sense.

- Get to code that actually does
  something as fast as possible

- Make the initial explinations as short
  as possible

- Focus on _how_ not _why_ at the start.

- Maybe: cycle through concepts (e.g varaibles
  with numbers, then if/then, then variables
  with booleans, then if/else., the variables
  with Strings, then if/else if/else)

- You don't have to explain everything all
  at once. (e.g. you don't have to explain
  floats in order to talk about integers and
  you don't have to talk about the bits an
  integer can take up or the signed vs
  unsigned versions when you first start.)

- Run off the idea that folks will go through
  the entire book. So, you don't need to explain
  everything all at once. (see also the other note
  about that)

- Only show one way to do something (e.g. with ranges
  instead of showing `(1..10)` and then explaining that
  if you want to actually get to ten, just show `(1..=10)`.

- Don't worry too much about explaing the syntax. That is:
  Show. Don't Tell.

- Avoid talking about what you'll show later. Wait until
  you get there. (This is a continuation of show don't tell)

- Avoid statements like "which we haven't talked about yet".
  If the person thinks about it at all, they'll know that's the
  case so there's littl point in mentioning it.

- Don't dig into every possible option at the start with edge
  cases. e.g. "In Rust, the `main()` function is used to kick
  things off" works find without having to. "In most programs,
  except for these types when its... whatever") It's like
  taking an 80/20 thing where the statement needs to be accurate
  but not all inclusive. Details of the different cases can
  be dealt with later.

- You can also use lanage like "basic variables are defined like"
  instead of "variables are defined like".
