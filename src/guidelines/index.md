# Guildlines

- Get to code that actually does
  something as fast as possible

- Make the initial explinations as short
  as possible

- Focus on _how_ not _why_ at the start.

- Maybe: cycle through concepts (e.g varaibles
  with numbers, then if/then, then variables
  with booleans, then if/else., the variables
  with Strings, then if/else if/else)

- You don't have to explain everything all
  at once. (e.g. you don't have to explain
  floats in order to talk about integers and
  you don't have to talk about the bits an
  integer can take up or the signed vs
  unsigned versions when you first start.)
