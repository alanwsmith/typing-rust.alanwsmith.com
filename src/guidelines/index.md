# Guildlines

- Get to code that actually does
  something as fast as possible

- Make the initial explinations as short
  as possible

- Focus on _how_ not _why_ at the start.

- Maybe: cycle through concepts (e.g varaibles
  with numbers, then if/then, then variables
  with booleans, then if/else., the variables
  with Strings, then if/else if/else)
