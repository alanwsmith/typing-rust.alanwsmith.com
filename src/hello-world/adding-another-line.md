# Hello, World (Another Line)

Now let's add another line of code in the
function to get used to typing stuff in.

Here's the example:

```rust,noplayground,EXAMPLE1
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World");
  println!("Is this thing on?");
}
```

The `main()` function now includes two `println!()`
statements. The output we're looking should have two lines.
The first with "Hello, World" and the
second with "Is thing thing on?"

Type that into the CODE RUNNER and
run it to see the output.
