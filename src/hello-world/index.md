# Hello, World - Explained

Let's look at the "Hello, World" code again:

```rust, noplayground
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World");
}
```

Those three lines of code are a complete program.
It may be simple, but when you've typed them in
you've officially written Rust.

There are snippets of code on the site that aren't
full programs. For example, this single line that's
been pulled out of of our program. We'll use those
to discuss specific aspects of the language.

```rust, noplayground
fn main() {
```

Those snippets don't need to be typed in.

The contents of every Source Code block _are_ complete
programs. Every Source Code block is paired directly
above a Code Runner editor to help make it clear what
to type.
