# Hello World

Okay, time to to start for real. Let's take
a look at the "Hello, World" code. Here
it is one more time.

```rust, noplayground, EXAMPLE1
fn main() {

  println!("Hello, World");

}
```

The first thing to point out is that it's a complete
Rust program. When you type it into the
Code Runner and hit Run the code is compiled and
executed directly.

It may be simple, but you've officially written Rust.
