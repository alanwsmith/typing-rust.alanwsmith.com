# Hello World

Time to to start for real. Let's
look at the "Hello, World" code again:

```rust, noplayground
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World");
}
```

Those three lines of code are a complete
program. It maybe simple, but when you type
them in you've officially written Rust.

There are snippets of code on the site designed
to show speicif aspect of the language that aren't
full programs, but every Source Code block is.
They would run the same if you installed Rust and
ran them from local files.
