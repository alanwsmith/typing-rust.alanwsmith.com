# Hello World

Okay, time to to start for real. Let's take
a look at the "Hello, World" code.

```rust, noplayground
fn main() {

  println!("Hello, World");

}
```

Those three lines of code are a complete
program. It maybe simple, but you've officially
written Rust.

Every "Source Code" block is a full program too.
They would run the same on your computer if you
installed Rust and ran them from local files.
