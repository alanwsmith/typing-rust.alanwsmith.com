# Hello World

A traditional approach to writing the first program
in a new language it to make it print "Hello, World".
This is how you do it in Rust.

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World");
}
```

This site includes code samples that can be run live.
The "Hello, World" sample above is one of them. Click
the "Run" button in the upper right to run the code.
It will show "Running" breifly followed by the "Hello, World"
output from the code itself.

Most examples have the Run button. There are some that
include snippets that can run on their own or that
demonstrate errors that don't have them, though.
