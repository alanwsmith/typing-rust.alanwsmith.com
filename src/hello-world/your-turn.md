# Hello, World (Your Turn)

The best way I know of to learn a programming language is
to type it a lot. This site also includes CODE RUNNER
areas for you to type in code and run it yourself.

For example, here's the code for the "Hello, World"
program again. Type it into the CODE RUNNER below
and click Run to see the output from your version
of the code.

```rust,noplayground,EXAMPLE1
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World");
}
```

#### CODE RUNNER

```rust,editable,CODE1

```
