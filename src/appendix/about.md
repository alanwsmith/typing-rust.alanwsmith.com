# About The Site

**DRAFT**

I started learning Rust with The Rust Book.
It was too much for me. There's too much explanation
and not enough code for the way I learn.

Short examples work better for me. Just a few lines of
code with no comments intertwined.

Documenting what I'm learning is another big part of
how I figure things out. This site combines both things.
It's a collection of refined exmaples
based off The Rust Book and Rust By Example with my
write ups.

I'm publishing it to help other folks who learn the
way I do.

## NOTES

- This is a work in progress. It's not even
  a full first draft yet.
- I'm filling out that pages, but they aren't in
  order yet.
- Most examples have a CODE EDITOR under them
  where you can type the code and run it. That's
  been very helpful for me.
- I've suppressed some warnings that would
  require making examples more complicated. None
  of them effect functonality and we'll cover
  them specifically in their own chapter.
