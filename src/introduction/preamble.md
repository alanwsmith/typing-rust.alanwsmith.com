# Preamble

There are a few other things to cover before we get
started with the code.

### The Content

- These are my actual, in-progress notes on learning
  Rust. As such, the site is very much a work in progress.
  It only goes far as I've made it in my studies.

- The content is designed for folks who have at least some
  programming experience. If you know what variables,
  functions, loops, and conditionals are, you'll be fine.

### The Examples

- Examples are kept intentionally sort. That often
  means doing things that would be silly in a useful
  program. For example, defining a variable that's
  used only once on the following line. The goal is to
  show _how_ to use something not _when_ to use it.

- Examples use the NATO phonetic alphabet (alfa,
  bravo, charlie, etc...). The words have no meaning
  beyond being labels or acting as content.

### Typing It In

- The approach of typing in examples may feel weird and
  frustrating at first if you've never done it. Give it
  5-10 pages to see if you start to find it useful.

- Of course, you can also read the site like a book without
  typing anything in if you learn better that way.

Now, let's get started with a better look at Hello, World.
