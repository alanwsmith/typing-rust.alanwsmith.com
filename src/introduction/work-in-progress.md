# Work In Progress

This site is a build-in-public project.
It's still a very early work in progress.

I'm working to make sure everything is
accurate, but there's lots of stuff
that's out of order and more stuff missing.

All that's to say, it's not ready to go
yet, but feel free to poke around.

Other notes to drop in.

- My source materials are [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
  (aka The Rust Book), [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/),
  [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings),
  and [Rust Adventure](https://www.rustadventure.dev/). I'm pulling what I learn
  from all those places and making the examples you see here

- Reading this site like a book without typing
  is perfectly acceptable. But, I think you'll get the most
  out of it by actually typing in the examples (and making all
  the typos that includes)

- You don't need to have Rust installed to use the site. All
  the examples are compiled and run directly in the browser
  via [The Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021)
