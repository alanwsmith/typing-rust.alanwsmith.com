# Welcome to Typing Rust

Hi. I'm Alan and I learn by doing. When it comes
to new programming languages, that means physically typing
in examples. I'm building this site to do just that with Rust.

The site is made of example source code blocks like this:

#### SOURCE CODE

```rust, noplayground, EXAMPLE1
fn main() {

  println!("Hello, World");

}
```

It also has Code Runners. They're
what the site is all about. Type in the source
code and click "Run". After displaying a brief
"Running..." message, the code will
compile and show the output (which is "Hello, World"
in this case).

#### CODE RUNNER

```rust, editable, CODE1

```
