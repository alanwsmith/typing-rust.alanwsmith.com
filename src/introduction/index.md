# Welcome to Typing Rust

The best way I know to learn something is to do it.
The best way I know to learn a new programming
language is to do it by typing in code examples yourself. I'm
building this site to teach myself rust by doing just that. It's made
of example source code blocks that look like this:

#### SOURCE CODE

```rust, noplayground, EXAMPLE1
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World");
}
```

There are also "Code Runner" blocks.
Typing source code into them is what the site
is all about. Give it a shot here with the Source Code
from above then click the
"Run" button. A new line will appear with a brief
"Running..." message followed by the code's output
(which is "Hello, World" in this case).

#### CODE RUNNER

```rust, editable, CODE1

```
