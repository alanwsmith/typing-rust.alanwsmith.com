# Welcome to Typing Rust

Hi! I'm Alan and I'm learning Rust.

The best way I know to learn something is to do it.
The best way I know to do that with a new programming
language is to copy examples by typing them in myself. I
built this site to learn rust by doing just that. It's made
of example code blocks that look like this:

#### EXAMPLE

```rust, noplayground, EXAMPLE1
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World");
}
```

There are also "Code Runner" sections. Typing the
example code into them is what the site
is all about. Give it a shot. Then, click the
"Run" button. A new line will appear with a brief
"Running..." message followed by the code's output
(which is "Hello, World" in this case).

#### CODE RUNNER

```rust, editable, CODE1

```

The "Status" line is there to help catch typos.
When you make one (which happens all the time
in programming) it'll show you the problem. Compare
it against the code in the example to figure
out how to correct it.

Once you've run the code and seen the result, use the
navigation below to move to the next page.
