# Welcome to Typing Rust

Hi. I'm Alan and I'm building this site to
learn Rust.

The best way I know to learn a programming language
is by typing examples into an editor and running them.
This site let you do just that. It's made of
**Source Code** blocks paired with **Code Runner** editors
you can use directly on the site.

The site works by typing the Source Code into the Code Runners and
hitting "Run" to see the output. Try it with the code
below and you'll see the output "Hello, World".

It can feel tedious at first, but stick with
it for a bit. You may find it works for you too.

#### SOURCE CODE

```rust, noplayground, EXAMPLE1
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World");
}
```

#### CODE RUNNER

```rust, editable, CODE1

```
