# Welcome to Typing Rust

I learn best by doing things. That means physicially
typing code examples when I'm learning a
new programming language. I'm buliding this site
to do that with Rust.

The site is made of example source
code blocks like this:

#### SOURCE CODE

```rust, noplayground, EXAMPLE1
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World");
}
```

It also has Code Runners. They're
what the site is all about. Type in the source
code from above and click "Run". It will
compile and show the output (which is "Hello, World"
in this case).

#### CODE RUNNER

```rust, editable, CODE1

```
