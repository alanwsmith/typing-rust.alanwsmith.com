# Welcome to Typing Rust

Hi. I'm Alan and I'm building this site to
learn Rust.

The best way I've found to learn a programming
language is to copy examples by typing them in and
running them. This site is setup to do just that.
It's made of **Source Code** and **Code Runner**
sections. You type the Source Code into
the Code Runners and click "Run" to see
the output.

It may feel a bit tedious at first. Try
a few to see if you start to find
it useful.

#### SOURCE CODE

```rust, noplayground, EXAMPLE1
fn main() {

  println!("Hello, World");

}
```

#### CODE RUNNER

```rust, editable, CODE1

```
