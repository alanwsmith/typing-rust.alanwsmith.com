# Welcome to Typing Rust

I learn best by doing things. In my case, that means
typing in source code examples when I'm learning
new programming langauge. I'm buliding this site
to do just that with Rust. It's made of example source
code blocks that look like this:

#### SOURCE CODE

```rust, noplayground, EXAMPLE1
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World");
}
```

It also has live "Code Runner" blocks. Using them
is what the site is all about. Type in the above source
code in and click "Run". It will
compile and show the output (which is "Hello, World"
in this case).

#### CODE RUNNER

```rust, editable, CODE1

```
