# Welcome to Typing Rust

Folks learn in different ways. I'm best actively
doing the whatever I'm learning. For programming
languages, that means typing in examples and running
them myself. There's something about physically
writing the code that helps set it in my brain.

I'm building this site to do that with Rust. It's
built with Source Code and Code Runner blocks. The
idea is to type the Source Code into the Code Runners
and run it.

It can be weird and a little frustrating at first.
Give it a few quick pages and see if you start to
find it useful. (There's also a button coming that
will let you just copy the code in automatically,
but that's still in progress)

The first Source Code to and Code Runner are below.
Give it a shot to see how it works and I hope
you enjoy the site.
