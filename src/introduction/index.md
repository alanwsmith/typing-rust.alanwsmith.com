# Welcome to Typing Rust

Hi. I'm Alan and I'm building this site to
learn Rust.

I've got plans to setup connections to
let you type in examples with a live
spell checker. That work is in progress.

For now, the site provides step by step
examples of each of the concepts it
covers. Here's the first one which
shows a basic "Hello, World".

#### Step By Step

<script>
const rawSourceCode = `fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World");
}`.split('\n')


const lineSets = [
{ 
  lines: [`0_r`, `0_r`, `0_r`],
  text: `<p></p>`
},
{ 
  lines: [`0_r`, `0_s`, `0_r`],
  text: `<p></p>`
},
{ 
  lines: [`0_c`, `0_r`, `0_c`],
  text: `<p></p>`
},
]
</script>
