# Welcome to Typing Rust

The best way I've found to learn a new programming
language is to copy examples by typing them in myself.
I built this site to learn rust by doing just that.

You'll find an example code block like this one
on each page:

#### EXAMPLE

```rust, noplayground, EXAMPLE1
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World");
}
```

"Code Runner" sections provide the place
to type in the code and run it. Here's the first one. Type in the
example code then hit "Run"
to see the results.

#### CODE RUNNER

```rust, editable, CODE1

```

The "Status" line is there to help catch typos.
When you make one (which is an everyday occurance
in programming) it'll show you the problem
so you can fix it.

After you've run it, use the navigation below to
move to the next one.
