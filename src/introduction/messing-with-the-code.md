# Messing With The Code

The Status line typo warnings won't prevent you from
running code. You can fiddle with the examples
and run them to see what happens even though the
warning will let you know you've drifted away
from the example source code.

I've got a feature on the road map to disable the
typo catcher. That'll make playing with the examples
more friendly since it won't be throwing the warning
at you when you change things.
