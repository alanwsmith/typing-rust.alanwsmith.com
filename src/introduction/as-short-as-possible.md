# As Short As Possible

Okay, last page of preamble

- I keep pages short (e.g. splitting this out to the third page
  instead of putting it on the first one). I find
  it makes it easier to focus and process.

- I keep examples sort for the same reason. Lots of times
  this means doing things that would be silly in a useful
  program (e.g. creating a variable that's only used once on the next line).
  The way to think about it is that the goal
  is to show you _how_ to use something not _when_ to use it.

- It frustrates the hell out of me when tutorails spend a bunch
  of time showing you how to do something one way only to hit
  you with "but that's not how anyone does it." I don't do
  that. We can cover alternate and historical ways to do things
  another time. But, for this phase of learning, I'm just focusing on
  one way to do it that most folks use most of the time.

- I use the NATO phonetic alphabet for names and values
  (e.g. alfa, bravo, charlie...). That's what those words
  are when you see them. They have no other
  meaning beyond being a label or content.

Now, let's get started with a better look at Hello, World.
