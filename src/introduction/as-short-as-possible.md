# As Short As Possible

Okay, last page of preamble

- I keep pages short. Preferring multiple short pages
  over one long one. I find it makes it easier to focus
  and process.

- I keep examples sort for the same reason. That often
  means doing things that would be silly in a useful
  program (e.g. creating a variable that's only used once on the next line).
  The goal is to show _how_ to use something
  not _when_ to use it.

- It frustrates the hell out of me when tutorails spend a bunch
  of time showing you one way to do something only to turn
  around and hit you with "but that's not how anyone actually
  does it." I don't do that. Learning the history of why
  something is the way can be left for later.

- I use the NATO phonetic alphabet for names and values
  (e.g. alfa, bravo, charlie...). That's what those words
  are when you see them. They have no other
  meaning beyond being a label or content.

Now, let's get started with a better look at Hello, World.
