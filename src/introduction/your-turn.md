# Hello, World - Your Turn

I learn best by doing. For programming
that means typing code examples into an
editor. The second feature of the site
is designed to do just that. You'll find
Source Code blocks paired with
Code Runners editors across the site.
They let you enter and run the code without
having to install Rust yourself.

Typing slows me down in beneficial
ways. I focus more on the the code. That
helps me understand and remember how things
work. The approach can take some getting
used to. Stick with it for a bit to see if
you start to see the benefit.

Here's the first one. It's the same
"Hello, World" as the example on the prior
page. Type it in and run it to see the
output.

### SOURCE CODE

```rust, noplayground, EXAMPLE1
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World");
}
```

### CODE RUNNER

```rust, editable, CODE1

```
