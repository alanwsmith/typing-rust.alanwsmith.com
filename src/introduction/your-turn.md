# Hello, World - Your Turn

I learn best by doing. For programming
languages that means typing code examples
into an editor. The second feature of this
site is designed to do just that. You'll
find Source Code blocks paired with Code
Runners across the site. The idea is to
type the code in and hit the "Run" button.
The code will complie, run, and show you
its output.

It can be frustrating and weird at first
but stick with it for a bit to see if
you don't start to see the benefit. Here's
the first one:

### SOURCE CODE

```rust, noplayground, EXAMPLE1
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World");
}
```

### CODE RUNNER

```rust, editable, CODE1

```
