# Yes, Type The Code

We need to cover two quick pages before
we get started for real.

- You don't need to have Rust installed to use the site. All
  the examples are compiled and run directly in the browser
  via [The Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021)

- This content starts at a level designed for folks who have
  at least a little bit of programming experience. For example,
  you know what variables, funcitons, for loops, and if/else/then
  conditionals are. (A primer is planned to get folks to that
  level as well, but it's still on the todo list.)

- These are my actual, in-progress notes. They only go as
  far as I've made it. There's also stuff I haven't figured out yet.
  You'll see "I think...", "I don't know...", and "TODO" stuff
  scattered around. That's all part of learning in public

- My source materials are [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
  (aka The Rust Book), [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/),
  [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings),
  and [Rust Adventure](https://www.rustadventure.dev/). I'm pulling what I learn
  from all those places and making the examples you see here

- Reading this site like a book without typing
  is perfectly acceptable. But, I think you'll get the most
  out of it by actually typing in the examples (and making all
  the typos that includes)

- If you've never learned a programming language by typing it
  in like this it will probably feel weird and frustrating at first.
  Give it like 5-10 pages and I expect you'll start to see
  why it's helpful
