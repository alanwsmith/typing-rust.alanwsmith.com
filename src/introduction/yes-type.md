# Yes, Type (Prep Note 1/2)

(_Draft_)

Okay. We need to cover two quick pages of things before
we get started for real.

- This content starts at a level designed for folks who have
  at least a little bit of programming experience. For example,
  you know what variables, for loops, and if/else/then conditionals
  are. (A primer is planned to get folks to that level as well, but
  it's still on the todo list.)

- All the examples are full programs. They are compiled
  and executed via The Rust Playground when you hit the Run button
  in the Code Runners.

- Reading this site like a book without typing in the examples
  would be similar to reading The Rust Book or Rust By Example,
  just with a different style of content.
  That's perfectly acceptable, but I think you'll get the most
  out of it by actually typing in the examples (and making all
  the typos that includes).

- If you've never learned a programming language by typing it
  in like this it will probably feel weird and frustrating at first.
  Give it like 5-10 pages and I expect you'll start to see
  why it's helpful.
