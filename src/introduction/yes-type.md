# Yes, Type The Code

We need to cover two quick pages before
we get started for real.

- I don't try to explain everything all at once. There will be
  parts in the early sections where I gloss over some things to make
  it easier to focus on another piece. If it feels like I skipped
  something that's what's happening and we'll get to further
  down the road.
