# Yes, Type The Code

We need to cover two quick pages before
we get started for real.

- These are my actual, in-progress notes. They only cover what
  I've learned so far. There's also stuff I haven't figured out yet.
  You'll see "I think...", "I don't know...", and "TODO" stuff
  scattered around along with misspellings. That's all part of
  learning in public

- This content starts at a level designed for folks who have
  at least some programming experience. If you know what
  variables, funcitons, loops, and conditionals are, you'll be fine.

- The approach I'm taking is somewhere between The Rust Book and
  Rust By Example. I'm use concise, issolated examples focused
  on a happy path to get started.

- I don't try to explain everything all at once. There will be
  parts in the early sections where I gloss over some things to make
  it easier to focus on another piece. If it feels like I skipped
  something that's what's happening and we'll get to further
  down the road.

- This approach may feel weird and frustrating if you've never done
  it before. Give it 5-10 pages to see if you start to find it useful.

- Of course, you can also read the site like a book without
  typing anything in if you learn better that way.
