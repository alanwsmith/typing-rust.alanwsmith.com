# The Status Line

Learning to read error message is a crital part of
programming. We'll cover them. But, hitting one
because you made a typo in a tutorail is a waste
of time, energy, and motivation.

You may have noticed the "Status" line in the
Code Runner. It's designed to eliminate typos by
highlighting them as soon as they occur and
showing you what character to use.

If you've ever entered a huge block of tutorial
code only to be hit with an indecipherable error
because of an unrelated typo, you know why I built it.

TODO: Make a way to turn off the alert so folks
can change the source code to experiment without
having the warning flash.
