# The Status Line

You may have noticed the "Status" line below
the Code Runner block. It's there
to help you catch typos as soon as they happen.
I built it becuase of my frustration
with tutorials that have long blocks of code
where I invariably make a typo then have to
spend time and energy hunting down a goof I made thirty
lines back before running the code.

Dealing with typos is a natural part of
programming. But, when I'm learning, they're nothing
but a huge energy drain and I've got precious
little of that.
