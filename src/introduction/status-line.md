# The Status Line

Learning to read error message is a crital part of
programming. We'll cover them. But, hitting one
because you made a typo in a tutorail is a waste
of time, energy, and motivation.

You may have noticed the "Status" line in the
Code Runner on the previous pages. It's designed
to eliminate typos by highlighting them as soon as
they occur and show you what character to use.

If you've ever entered a huge block of tutorial
code only to be hit with an indecipherable error
because of an unrelated typo, you know why I built it.
