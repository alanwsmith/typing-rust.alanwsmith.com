# The Status Line

You may have noticed the "Status" line above
the Code Runner. It's an experiment to see if
we can improve coding tutorails by eliminating
typos.

If you've ever done a tutorail where you entered
a huge block of code only to get hit with an
unrelated error message, you know why I built it.

Understanding error messages is a critical part of
learning a language. But, if you're not actively
studdying how to read them, error messages from
typos are a waste of time, energy, and motivation.

#### NOTES

- The Status line typo warnings won't prevent you from
  running code. You can fiddle with the examples
  and run them to see what happens even though the
  warning will let you know you've drifted away
  from the example source code

- I've got a feature on the roadmap to disable the
  typo catcher. That'll make playing with the examples
  more friendly since it won't be throwing the warning
  at you when you change things
