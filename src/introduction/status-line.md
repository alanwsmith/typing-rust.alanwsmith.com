# The Status Line

You may have noticed the "Status" line above
the Code Runner. It's designed eliminate typos. If
you've ever done a tutorial where you entered a huge
block of code only to get hit with a seemingly random
error message from a typo then you know why I built it.

If you made it through the previous "Hello World"
example without making a typo, try it here again but
make some intentional typos. The Status line will
show you the text from the current line that's
correct in gray. It then highlights the typo in red
showing you what character it should be.
