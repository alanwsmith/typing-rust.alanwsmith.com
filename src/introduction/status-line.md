# The Status Line

The other key feature of the site is the "Status"
line that you may have noticed below the
code runner. It's there
to catch typos as soon as they happen.
I built it becuase of my frustration
with tutorials that have long blocks of code
where I invariably make a typo then
spend a bunch of time and energy hunting down a goof I made thirty
lines back before running the code.

Dealing with typos is a natural part of
programming. But, when I'm learning, they're nothing
but huge energy and motivation vampires.

#### NOTES

- The typo catcher is very strict. For example, typing a lowercase
  "h" instead of an uppercase one in "Hello, World" will cause a warning.
  It can be a little annoying, but it's way better than not having it.

- Typo warnings won't prevent you from running the code. This means
  you can fiddle with the examples and run them to see what happens even
  though the warning will let you know you've drifted away from the example
  source code.

- I've got a feature on the roadmap to disable the typo catcher. That'll
  make playing with the examples a little more friendly since it won't be
  throwing the warning at you
