# The Status Line

You may have noticed the Code Runner's "Status" line.
It's designed to eliminate typos. If you've entered
a huge block of code for a tutorail and got hit
with an indecipherable error message becuase
you made a typo you know why I built it.

If you made it through "Hello World" on the previos
page without making a typo, try it again but
make some intentional mistakes. The Status line will
highlight the character you need to fix.

(You can click "Run" when the typo warning is showing.
You'll probably get a sizable error message, but that's
fine. It won't hurt anything.)
