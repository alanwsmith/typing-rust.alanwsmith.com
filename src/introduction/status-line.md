# The Status Line

You may have noticed the "Status" line above
the Code Runner. It's an experiment to see if
we can improve coding tutorails by eliminating
typos.

If you've ever done a tutorail where you entered
a huge block of code only to get hit
with an error message you didn't
understand, you know why I built
it.

Learning how to read error messages is an
important skill, but if they're not what you're
actively working on then fighting them becuase of
typos is a waste of time, energy, and motivation.

#### NOTES

- Typo warnings won't prevent you from running the code. This means
  you can fiddle with the examples and run them to see what happens even
  though the warning will let you know you've drifted away from the example
  source code.

- I've got a feature on the roadmap to disable the typo catcher. That'll
  make playing with the examples a little more friendly since it won't be
  throwing the warning at you
